ww1_infantry2_equip:0 "새로운 보병 철모"
ww1_infantry2_equip_desc:0 "우리 보병에게 제공되는 가죽 모자와 챙모자는 그야말로 현시대 전장에선 더 이상 적합하지 않으며, 그러한 모자류를 개선하려는 시도는 그저 한정된 성과를 보일 뿐이다. 강철로 만든 신규 헬멧을 채택한다고 확실한 방탄 성능을 확보할 순 없겠지만, 머리 경상을 더 쉽게 방지할 수 있을 것이다."

ww1_ambulance1:0 "기마 구급차"
ww1_ambulance1_desc:0 "현대식 마차가 우리 군에 도입됨으로 구급차량 규격화가 가능해졌으며, 사상자를 재빨리 전선 밖으로 호송시켜 신속한 처치를 할 수 있게 되었다. 승차감은 멀미 나고 탑승감은 딱히 쾌적하지 않겠지만, 포탄 구덩이에서 부상을 치료하는 것보다는 확실히 나을 것이다."
ww1_ambulance2:0 "기계화 구급차"
ww1_ambulance2_desc:0 "구급 마차를 자동차로 교체함으로, 병력을 전선에서 훨씬 빨리 후송시킬 수 있게 될 것이고 한시가 급한 상황에서 생명을 구하는 데 도움이 될 거다. 마력이 향상된 차량들은 부드러운 승차감과 더욱 효율적인 몰자 수송이 가능해지며, 게다가 사상자 복귀율 또한 향상된다."

ww1_oil1:0 "석유 시추"
ww1_oil1_desc:0 "Oil and its uses have been known since the late 19th century, and sadly, most of our oil extraction ability dates much the same. Modernizing our oil wells will increase our take of this valuable substance to a good degree."
ww1_oil2:0 "진보된 석유 시추"
ww1_oil2_desc:0 "Oil is elusive- it hides underground, where none can see it. For this reason, it's imperitive that we develop more efficient ways to locate it. By improving our oil drilling capabilities, we can find and, therefore, exploit more oil around existing reserves."
ww1_oil3:0 "석유 시추공 훈련"
ww1_oil3_desc:0 "With the recent advances in the tools to find and extract oil, we cannot let our workers be the reason our efforts fall behind. By establishing training standards for oil field workers in both the private and public sector, we can make sure less oil is wasted, further bolstering our newfound reserves of black gold."

ww1_tools3:0 "상급 공구"
ww1_tools3_desc:0 "Even old pharoah Menes would have been familiar with the hammer and nail, but modern industries allow us to produce more, superior, and standardized tools, allowing increased productivity in our workshops and industries around the world- so long as they can find that damned 8mm wrench..."


ww1_fortification1:0 "보방의 방어 작업"
ww1_fortification1_desc:0 "Fortifications seem like a no-brainer to construct, and to a degree, this much is the case. However, effective design and positioning of forts is important to get any serious use out of them, and Vauban's Works, despite being published hundreds of years ago, still ring true to this day. Studying this will allow superior fortification construction."

ww1_fortification2:0 "참호 파기"
ww1_fortification2_desc:0 "Forts on their own are nice, but in today's Trench Warfare, integrating them into our existing trench systems would be even better. Construction of smaller forts that are interlocked with our trenches will not only give us superior forts, but also give troops in the garrison a far easier way out if need be."

ww1_fortification3:0 "강화된 콘크리트"
ww1_fortification3_desc:0 "Even the substance we construct our fortifications out of can still yet be improved. Reinforcing our concrete will lead to more stable, solid fortifications, less vulnerable to enemy artillery strikes."

ww1_fortification3b:0 "방어적인 벙커"
ww1_fortification3b_desc:0 "Forts on their own are good defenses, but there's not much room or time to construct one when the trench line moves up. Bunkers, being smaller and much faster to construct, can help our defensive lines in fortified sectors stay secure."

ww1_fortification4:0 "대공포 지원"
ww1_fortification4_desc:0 "The advent of Aircraft provide a new, quite difficult challenge to deal with when constructing fortification lines. It is a lot more difficult to build around a falling bomb than even, say, an artillery shell. Anti-Aircraft guns, therefore, should be set up to support our forts, and keep them defensible even in the modern war."




ww1_medicine1:0 "새로운 의료 기기"
ww1_medicine1_desc:0 "The era of surgery being a matter of bonesaws and booze is over, thank god. New instruments like the Hirtz Compass and new techniques for existing instruments like Intravenous Blood Transfusion should help to save several of our boys on the battlefield."

ww1_medicine2:0 "군의학"
ww1_medicine2_desc:0 "Bullets are not the only deadly force in combat. The grim taxman of death is well known to take his due toll on soldiers, especially in the stagnant Trench Warfare. Ensuring mass production of vitamins, antibiotics, and other chemical cures- and of course, making sure that they all work as intended- will lead to far less easily preventable casualties for our troops."

ww1_medicine3:0 "살균소독 개선"
ww1_medicine3_desc:0 "No, don't worry, we're not starting a national vasectomy campaign. Part of the horror of war is filth- the image of a surgeon arm-deep in a patient with blood from another man on his hands is common, but not good. Ensuring there are appropritate sanitation measures taken for our medics can stop them from doing more harm than good."

ww1_medicine4:0 "백신 접종 운동"
ww1_medicine4_desc:0 "No one enjoys getting a shot, but on the battlefield, being immunized to common diseases could save your life- no sick soldier fights well, after all. Though vaccination is still not yet fully understood, we know enough about the science to know that it's got direct, positive benefits- and who could resist saving more manpower?"

ww1_medicine5:0 "병원 현대화"
ww1_medicine5_desc:0 "Though our field surgeons are now all well and good, we cannot forget our proper hospitals behind the lines. Ensuring that these men have everything they need to deal with all possible comers suffering afflictions from shell shock to gas wounds, and even, perhaps, perform reconstructive surgery or other wild new techniques, will lead to even more men surviving a close encounter of the front lines."

hoi4tgw_decryption_desc:0 "Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext."

hoi4tgw_encryption:0 "암호화 - 암호작성"
hoi4tgw_encryption_desc:0 "Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to encryption, which is the process of converting ordinary information into unintelligible text."
