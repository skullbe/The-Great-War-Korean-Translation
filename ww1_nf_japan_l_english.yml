The most dire risk being anyone who lands too close to the capital could simply oust our government, and our low landmass means that a few divisions may secure giant portions of our territory quickly. Japan must be unassailable, or it will not survive."

JAP_ww1_Japan_Korea_Treaty:0 "한일 병합 조약"
JAP_ww1_Japan_Korea_Treaty_desc:0 "Korea has been long a puppet state of our empire, but it would serve better as territory. If we force the puppet Emperor into an annexation agreement, we can knock it off the map in a fashion just seemingly diplomatic enough to keep Europe and the Americans off of our backs, which will establish our first territory on the Asian mainland."

JAP_ww1_Japanese_Expansionism:0 "일본 팽창주의"
JAP_ww1_Japanese_Expansionism_desc:0 "The most logical solution to Japan's issues of low amounts of natural resources and tenuous defensive position is simply to expand outwards.

JAP_ww1_Pro_British_desc:0 "The British are technically allied to us, and were one of the few European nations to invest heavily in Japan's navy. Siding with them will, if nothing else, ensure we never have to face the fearsome Royal Navy until we're prepared."

JAP_ww1_Invade_Singapore_desc:0 "Singapore is a major British port in Asia, in position to allow them to continue control over Hong Kong, help keep the Pacific secured, and other unfortunate benefits.

JAP_ww1_Siege_of_Tsingtao:0 "칭다오 전투"

JAP_ww1_Thirteen_Demands_desc:0 "Though China would be in no position to resist Japan, the rest of the European powers as well as the United States are unified in threatening us with an embargo in the case of going too far with China. If we simply demand an inheiritance to the German economic sphere, we can expand our influence in China without damaging our position." 

JAP_ww1_Twenty_One_Demands:0 "21번째 요구"
JAP_ww1_Twenty_One_Demands_desc:0 "Though the West may denounce us for it, China as a puppet state is a deal far too good to pass up. With their manpower and resources and our cunning and might, we would be an unstoppable force! Of course, if they reject our demands, we may have to either revise, or prepare for a war which would most certainly unify the dissenting powers..."

JAP_ww1_Appeasement_China_desc:0 "China is in a position to give a little, but it would be better for us both to walk out saving face.

JAP_ww1_Pressure_China:0 "중국 압박"
JAP_ww1_Pressure_China_desc:0 "It is only a matter of time until Japan dominates East Asia. China is a crucial step to our brilliant master plan!

JAP_ww1_South_Manchuria_Railway_Zone:0 "남만주 철도 부설"
JAP_ww1_South_Manchuria_Railway_Zone_desc:0 "We have controlled the South Manchuria Railway since 1905. However, with China too tied up in its civil war to resist, we can easily expand precisely what it means to control the railways and what is southern Manchuria, until we have near full control of the region. And due to the war, it's unlikely they'd ever be able to resist."

JAP_ww1_Claim_Manchuria:0 "만주 영유권 주장"
JAP_ww1_Claim_Manchuria_desc:0 "Now that the Manchurian Qing dynasty no longer exercizes effective control in China, we could garner a bit of local support for a Manchu government. This will nearly inevitably lead to conflict in war-torn China, but what could they possibly to do resist?"

JAP_ww1_siberian_intervention:0 "시베리아 중재"

JAP_ww1_Celebrate_Tsushima_desc:0 "The battle of Tsushima was a devestating blow to the Russian fleet, and one of Japan's greatest moments.

JAP_ww1_Russian_Revolution_Opportunity:0 "러시아 혁명의 기회"
JAP_ww1_Russian_Revolution_Opportunity_desc:0 "The Russian Revolution has opened up a nice chance for Japan to earn yet more mainland territory.
