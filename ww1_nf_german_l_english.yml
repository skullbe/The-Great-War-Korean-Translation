# [GERMAN EMPIRE] Army Effort
#=========================================================================
GER_ww1_army_effort:0 "독일 육군 중점"
GER_ww1_army_effort_desc:0 "The German Army is a powerful force indeed. Numerically inferior only to the Russian army, but far more disciplined, trained, well led, and well equipped than the forces of the Bear, our land force is among the world's greatest- if not THE world's greatest. However, that does not mean we can stay comfortably in such a position. We must continue to improve our military, especially on theory and doctrine, to ensure we never fall behind."

GER_ww1_trenchwarfare:0 "참호전 중점"
GER_ww1_trenchwarfare_desc:0 "Since Gatling and Maxim introduced their unholy weapons of warfare, our nation has been keenly interested in strategies based around the defense of Trench lines, which were first seen as far back as the American Civil War. We must seek experts in this theory- both field and armchair generals- in order to advance our knowledge in tomorrow's Land Doctrines."

GER_ww1_artillery_effort_1:0 "포병 개발"
GER_ww1_artillery_effort_1_desc:0 "One step to expand our young military modernization program is further development of our Artillery batteries. Seeking out designers for new weapons is a logical first step, and once our project is completed, we expect to reap the benefits of an easily-designed new Artillery piece."

GER_ww1_artillery_effort_2:0 "포병 개발 II"

GER_ww1_artillery_effort_2_desc:0 "Now that we have gathered some accomplished Artillery designers, it seems logical to support their endeavors with their own factories. By assigning these men as full-time designers and engineers, and putting workers under them, we can easily make advancements in the field of Artillery." 

GER_ww1_artillery_effort_3:0 "포병 개발 III"
GER_ww1_artillery_effort_3_desc:0 "Field tests are proving a major issue with our artillery pieces: The wide variety of calibers we're using for various ranges and models of Artillery is proving a costly endeavor, and reducing the effectiveness of our cannons on the field. By enforcing a few standard sizes for our guns, we can produce new models of Artillery that give us, quite literally, more bang for our buck." 

GER_ww1_artillery_effort_4:0 "포병 개발 IV"
GER_ww1_artillery_effort_4_desc:0 "Though the direct-fire Field Gun was thought to be on its way out from the battlefield, our quartermasters are actually beginning to request more and more of these light pieces, instead of just demanding more of the Howitzers and Siege Guns. Focusing our efforts on new direct-fire guns, and perhaps more rounds to compensate, will not only inevitably lead to superior models, but perhaps lead to some unexpected advantages elsewhere as well..." 

GER_ww1_special_forces:0 "특수부대"
GER_ww1_special_forces_desc:0 "For all of its horror, Chemical Warfare has, by sheer accident, introduced us to a class of incredibly disciplined troops with lightning reaction times, superior to the other groups in our army. These men seem quite useful to act as Marines, Mountain troops, and other hardy classes of Infantry which are above the caliber of the standard Rifleman. Seeking out these men and good officers for them could lead to some much more effective Special Forces. If only there were a way for them to get to the battle faster, like the Cavalry of the old days..." 

GER_ww1_army_motorization_focus:0 "기계화 중점"
GER_ww1_army_motorization_focus_desc:0 "Some of our geniuses in the General Staff- or perhaps just men fed up with the stalemates of Trench Wafare- have proposed mass-producing vehicles specifically for troop transportation, which would allow our men to get to and from battlefields faster- and, perhaps, around it as well. Of course, even this simple act requires specific equipment and training, which means an investment- though one that could easily pay off." 

GER_ww1_doctrine_effort:0 "교리 개선"
GER_ww1_doctrine_effort_desc:0 "Though the era of the General Staff consisting of the princes of the realm has long ended, several of our Generals and other high-ranking officers were chosen for our armies not because of skill, but for connections or family ties. Though this keeps them loyal, other nations are beginning to become more serious and competitive with their own top brass. We must begin appointments for merit- though still, hopefully, not let too much of the common riff-raff into the esteemed General Staff..." 

GER_ww1_doctrine_effort_2:0 "교리 개선 II"
GER_ww1_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "Though our General Staff has now been made thoroughly merit-based, perhaps they aren't the only ones who can assist in our military doctrines. A class of men who have been mostly dormant since the early 1800s- straight military theorists- are beginning to appear once again. Though many of these men have limited combat experience, their study in war cannot be ignored. Integrating them into our staff could prove beneficial for our military tactics." 

GER_ww1_doctrine_effort_3:0 "교리 개선 III"
GER_ww1_doctrine_effort_3_desc:0 "One of our critical elements of warfare has largely been ignored up to now: Logistics. With so much focus on the capability of troops in combat, we must ensure they get there in a timely fashion, and have, at least, food, water, and a weapon. Giving experts on this subject a voice, as well as more training for supply vehicle drivers, would have immediate benefits for our land doctrines, but perhaps future additional benefits as well." 

GER_ww1_equipment_effort:0 "장비 개선"
GER_ww1_equipment_effort_desc:0 "Our generals are not the only old guard keeping our military in the last century. Our Quartermasters still have some of the 19th century Military issues of corruption and disconnection behind them. By selecting the most well-liked and in-tune officers, we can, most importantly, learn the faults of our current weapons, allowing us to produce corrected and improved designs more quickly- as well as ensure that these men don't get TOO popular!" 

GER_ww1_equipment_effort_2:0 "장비 개선 II"
GER_ww1_equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "Our new Quartermasters have taken to us with requests for not simply newer rifles, but newer support weapons as well. Experience with this new-pattern army has led to ideas like lighter machine guns, trench mortars, and rifle grenades, which all seem quite useful, so long as we can get the right people on designing them and manufacturing them." 

GER_ww1_equipment_effort_3:0 "장비 개선 III"
GER_ww1_equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "The Quartermasters have sent a letter of demands for more rifles equipped for the conditions of trenches- those able to launch rifle grenades, attach bayonets or scopes, and more carbines. Though we could simply produce more straight up, it seems like a logical move is to bring our rifles to the standard of being able to do all of these things- which means a new, improved design." 

GER_ww1_equipment_effort_4:0 "장비 개선 IV"
GER_ww1_equipment_effort_4_desc:0 "Our Quartermasters have, unfortunately, sent us yet another list of demands. Luckily, we have instructed our postmasters to ignore any further mail from them. Their last demand is new equipment for our Engineer corps- new models of Carbine, new tools, and perhaps those new Flamethrowers, which will be commissioned as soon as possible. Of course, expanding the Engineer corps as such could provide for some unseen benefits..." 

GER_ww1_armor_effort_1:0 "기갑 개발"
GER_ww1_armor_effort_1_desc:0 "Our prior investments have paid off! Artillery designers, Engineers, and vehicle designers have proposed to us a brand new type of vehicle- a heavily armored tractor with a direct fire gun. Though early designs are clearly not battle ready, this concept has strong promise- particularly in the field of ending the Trench stalemate in our favor, if these landships can stand up to machine gun fire, as is claimed."

GER_ww1_armor_effort_2:0 "기갑 개발 II"
GER_ww1_armor_effort_2_desc:0 "Our experiments with armor have been a rousing success! However, we cannot be complacent with our current designs. Engineers have been proposing interesting concepts like rotating gun turrets, specific engine compartments, and a hatch for use by a commander, which cannot be ignored. If we are to be the first to make these ideas a reality, perhaps we could become unstoppable!"

GER_ww1_gasmask_focus:0 "화학전 중점"
GER_ww1_gasmask_focus_desc:0 "Some of our chemists have proposed the use of a new, incredibly deadly agent- poisonous gas, delivered by our artillery and trench mortars. Though chemical warfare has been frowned on for roughly a century, what choice do we have if we are to win the war? Beyond investing in these, it's also likely for the best to develop countermeasures quickly- it would be unfortunate for such an advancement to turn on us!"

GER_ww1_aviation_effort:0 "독일 공군 편제"
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_desc:0 "As one of the first nations to use a military airplane, we have a distinct advantage in the initial organization of a new Air branch of our armed forces. Despite this, there are still many yards of red tape, many debates, and many philosophical arguments to be had about this new branch's role and independence- which will inspire in itself advances in our doctrine."

GER_ww1_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "Now that we have formally established an Air Force, we have made some interesting advances. Most notably, our aircraft designers have been proposing designs for specific roles, rather than simply arming a generic model. Getting effective use out of these planes, which will be designed with roles like attacking enemy aircraft or dropping bombs in mind, will require extensive testing and research, but will no doubt prove beneficial." 
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_3:0 "비행기 중점 II"
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_3_desc:0 "The development of the Synchronised Machine Gun has changed the rules of the Aircraft game. Fighters are now far more effective, our Zeppelins might be seeing their last flights, and we need innovative thinkers to help keep us on pace with this extreme development. If we become the master of this new development, which will perhaps change the air war as much as ground warfare, we will be well on our way to Air Superiority." 
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_4:0 "비행기 중점 III"
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_4_desc:0 "Our Air Force, which was established only recently, has now integrated itself completely into the rest of our armed forces. This brings us the obvious benefit of a pool of theorists, engineers, designers, and experts still at our door- as well as a new class of ''Ace'' pilots, who are even becoming minor celebrities. Hiring on these people certainly can't hurt us, and will lead to nice developments in our field." 
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_5:0 "비행기 중점 IV"
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_5_desc:0 "With the development of brand new types of aircraft, such as the Tactical and Strategic Bomber, we have yet more testing and theorycrafting to do on exactly the best way to get use out of this influx of new models. Some are already speculating that bombers may be a wonder weapon capable of deciding a war. What poppycock!"

GER_ww1_pilotformation_1:0 "비행사 편제"
GER_ww1_pilotformation_1_desc:0 "Currently, Aircraft fly solo- distant from each other, and engaging in one-on-one duels with any enemies they might encounter. However, with more and more machines in the sky, it's becoming clear that this is no longer the most viable way to engage in air combat. Some of our physicists may be valuable in helping us to determine new formations for our pilots to use."

GER_ww1_pilotformation_2:0 "비행사 편제 II"
GER_ww1_pilotformation_2_desc:0 "The new formations we have established have indeed been a boon to us in combat. However, ensuring people stick to the formations is a different story entirely. Encouraging our top aces to put out a manual for our pilots on air tactics and formation will ensure our pilots stick to doing what's best- and perhaps, these sorts of writings will help spread new tricks and doctrines."

GER_ww1_aircraftprod_1:0 "항공 생산"
GER_ww1_aircraftprod_1_desc:0 "Though Engineers have been making aircraft for us on a decent scale, it is simply time to introduce factories outright to the concept. Putting planes into mass production will help us flood the sky with friendly craft- and, more importantly, help us deprive our enemies of the same advantage. On top of that, who knows? Maybe some of these factory engineers may have some good ideas for aircraft designs..."

GER_ww1_airbomb_1:0 "폭격기 중점"
GER_ww1_airbomb_1_desc:0 "While the tactics of our fighters are improving with formations, our bombers are still very basic machines with very basic doctrines. Some of our old airship bombers possess now essentially unused expertise, which could help the latter as time solves the former. By utilizing these men, we can ensure that the old lessons of bombing are not lost on newer craft."
GER_ww1_airbomb_2:0 "폭격기 중점 II"
GER_ww1_airbomb_2_desc:0 "All of the recent developments to air warfare, both in theory and in practice, have given birth to a golden age of aircraft development. From pilots down to the plane mechanics, it seems that everyone has something to improve and potentially offer, which we can use on a national level. Perhaps one day, Aircraft may be the most important weapon in war...nah, probably not." 

GER_ww1_air_innovation:0 "공군 혁신"
GER_ww1_air_innovation_desc:0 "One of our aspiring, mid-level air officers recently displayed the conclusion of a project he had been working on in secret. A seaplane was launched from a static ship, dropped a bomb onto one of our old scrappers, sinking the poor old vessel, before the plane returned and docked once again. Though most of our high command was unimpressed, attention from the head of state could certainly give this ambition a boost."

GER_ww1_back_austria:0 "오-헝을 지원한다"
GER_ww1_back_austria_desc:0 "Beginning a diplomatic push to further ties with Austria-Hungary will alienate Italy to a degree, but perhaps they can learn from Austria-Hungary's level of loyalty in this case?"

GER_ww1_send_advisor:0 "독일 고문관 파견"
GER_ww1_send_advisor_desc:0 "German advisors, particularly in the military, will be warmly recieved by both Italy and Austria-Hungary, and further our relations with both nations, while costing Germany little but finding men worthy of the task and putting them on a train out."

GER_ww1_turkey_friend:0 "오스만과의 친선"
GER_ww1_turkey_friend_desc:0 "The Ottoman Empire is in desperate need of more friends, and as it just so happens, so are we. Though their military has been rocked by some recent sound defeats, our neighbor France has already recovered from a far worse trouncing, so what's stopping them?"

GER_ww1_zimmermann_telegram:0 "치머만 전보 전달"
GER_ww1_zimmermann_telegram_desc:0 "Mexico, as unstable as it is, could be the key to keeping the US out of the war. If we form a defensive alliance with Mexico, the US will be forced to think twice about declaring war on us, with a neighbor next door to contend with. Of course, we would look incredibly bad if the telegram was intercepted, particularly if it was mistranslated and exaggerated."

GER_ww1_baghdad:0 "베를린-바그다드 철도"
GER_ww1_baghdad_desc:0 "The planned Berlin-Baghdad railway is an ambitious rail project seeking to connect the German capital to the Ottoman heartlands, where a good chunk of the Ottoman oil lies. "

GER_asienkorps:0 "아시아 군단"
GER_asienkorps_desc:0 ""

GER_ww1_assert_position_west:0 "서유럽에 독일의 권리 주장"
GER_ww1_assert_position_west_desc:0 "The Western front is a gloomy place for the Central Powers. France and the UK have bonded against us and our interests, which hurts the German future in Africa. Worse yet, Belgium doesn't seem quite so willing anymore to let German troops through to crush the French, who they no longer see as a threat. We must make the most of a bad situation if we are to stay afloat as a great power." 

GER_ww1_anti_fr:0 "반프랑스 정책"
GER_ww1_anti_fr_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, the Germans and the French have been enemies. If we act around this reality, it opens up new and interesting options to deal with them in the future."

GER_ww1_anti_uk:0 "반영국 정책"
GER_ww1_anti_uk_desc:0 "While the Anglo-German friendship was nice while it lasted, Germany and the United Kingdom have come to bear with each other in recent years, and it seems like this won't be reversed any time soon. Acknowledging our rivalry outright will open up some options to circumvent them diplomatically."

GER_ww1_support_boer:0 "독일령 남아프리카 강화"
GER_ww1_support_boer_desc:0 "DSWA, also known as Namibia, is one of Germany's most important colonies. Ensuring that it's defensible in an attack could serve to help out our nation's war efforts if it came down to it, and this would only take minor investment."

GER_ww1_support_boer_war:0 "보어 봉기"
GER_ww1_support_boer_war_desc:0 "The Boers of South Africa are still only recently conquered, and not adjusted to British rule quite yet. If we supply and train some of the Boers who seek independence from the UK, they may be able to rise up against South African officials, giving us a rare advantage in a mostly Entente-controlled region of the world."

GER_ww1_agadir_crisis:0 "아가디르 사태"
GER_ww1_agadir_crisis_desc:0 "With rebels organizing in Morocco, and just enough German interest in the region to proclaim them relevant, we can support their insurrection against the French goverment to try and seize Morocco for ourselves. While that goal in itself is unlikely, we can, if nothing else, shake down France for more reasonable territory if we grill them enough, though this may draw the UK even closer to them."

GER_ww1_assert_position_east:0 "동유럽에 독일의 권리 주장"
GER_ww1_assert_position_east_desc:0 "The position of the Central Powers in the East is the same- weaken Russia, and build hegemony in the region. As war with Russia in particular seems to be nearly inevitable, due to the Balkan situation, this is an effective course of action to take, though will drive France and Russia closer, which could prove to be an issue."

GER_ww1_anti_ru:0 "반러시아 정책"
GER_ww1_anti_ru_desc:0 "Russia is no friend of ours, and perhaps never will be again, due to their extravagant claims on not only friendly territory but our own Polish land. Accepting this truth could lead to some new ways to deal with them down the line." 

GER_ww1_anti_serb:0 "반 세르비아 정책"
GER_ww1_anti_serb_desc:0 "세르비아인들은 단지 오스트리아의 보스니아 지역을 얻을 수 있다면, 그들의 어머니마저도 팔아먹을 쥐새끼들이다. 만약 우리가 그들이 우리의 적국이라는 것을 인지하고 마주한다면 우리는 그들에게 대항할 준비를 할 수 있을 것이다."

GER_ww1_bulgaria_puppet:0 "불가리아 괴뢰화"
GER_ww1_bulgaria_puppet_desc:0 "Bulgaria proved with its lackluster performances in the Balkan wars that it is of no true use as an ally. Enforcing a puppet state over them may alienate some outsiders, but what does it matter? It's simply another impoverished Balkan hellhole, just like all the others." 

GER_ww1_bulgaria_friend:0 "불가리아와의 친선"
GER_ww1_bulgaria_friend_desc:0 "Bulgaria has much to gain in a war against Serbia, and another two of our potential enemies in Greece and Romania. If we promise them claims on Macedonia and Thrace, which Austria-Hungary doesn't even have any desire to contest them for, they could join us, opening up a second front to relieve our overstretched forces, and give us another source of much-needed manpower."

GER_ww1_ready_country:0 "전쟁 준비"
GER_ww1_ready_country_desc:0 "장군들은 싸움에 대해 염려하고 있다. 그들은 협상국 군대가 우리에게 뭔가 끔찍한 것을 계획하고 있다고 믿기 시작했다. 우리는 반드시 전투 준비를 해야 하며, 그리고 반드시 선제 공격을 할 준비가 되어 있어야 한다. 그렇지 않다면 우리는 다가오는 충돌에서 생존하지 못할 것이다."

GER_ww1_strengthen_kaiser:0 "황제의 권위 강화"
GER_ww1_strengthen_kaiser_desc:0 "국왕 폐하의 독일 통치를 의심해서는 안 된다. 그는 격동의 시기에서도 기댈 수 있는 인물이며, 또한 제국을 위해서라면 수단과 방법을 가리지 않고 지원할 수 있는 인물이다. 그러므로, 헌법 개정안에서부터 의회의 새로운 법률까지 우리가 할 수 있는 모든 조치를 통해 빌헬름 각하의 권력을 지켜야 한다."

GER_ww1_weaken_kaiser:0 "황제의 권위 약화"
GER_ww1_weaken_kaiser_desc:0 "빌헬름 2세는 스스로...'흥미로운' 지도자라는 것을 조금도 과장하지 않고 입증했다. 그가 독일 제국에 더 이상의 피해를 끼치는 것을 막기 위해, 그의 독일에 대한 통제력을 제한하고 더 유능한 인물들에게 권력을 위임하는 것이 최선이다." 

GER_ww1_restructure_ostafrika:0 "독일령 동아프리카 개편"
GER_ww1_restructure_ostafrika_desc:0 "동아프리카는 우리의 최대 식민지이지만, 그게 우리가 그곳에서 더 많은 일들을 할 수 없다는 의미는 아니다. 식민지 총독부의 역할과 행정 권한을 확대함으로서 그들은 그 지역을 우리를 위해 효율적으로 개발할 수 있다."
GER_ww1_train_ostafrika:0 "독일 아프리카 수비대 배치"
GER_ww1_train_ostafrika_desc:0 "Our colonial administrators have reported a large amount of local East African men who are unemployed fighters, looking to serve in the German army. If we can find some volunteers to train and lead this group, we could, if nothing else, hold out against British forces in the area as long as possible."

GER_ww1_war_with_france:0 "1915년 슐리펜 계획"
GER_ww1_war_with_france_desc:0 "드디어 시간이 왔다! 프랑스는 벨기에를 통해 공격당할 것이며, 우리는 그들이 모르는 사이 파리에 입성할 것이다! 우리의 동부 방어선은 형편없지만, 알 게 뭐냐? 서쪽에서 온 병력들이 그들을 도와줄 것이다!  반드시 그래야 한다! 카이저께서 원하시기 때문에, 그렇게 될 것이다!"

GER_ww1_polnische_wehrmacht:0 "폴란드 국방군"
GER_ww1_polnische_wehrmacht_desc:0 "If we promise the Poles their own nationstate after the war, perhaps the residents of our part of Poland will be more willing to join in on the action. Whether we cede the territory or not is, of course, a matter to be decided yet, but for now, we can enjoy the influx of able-bodied men without thinking of the consequences."

GER_ww1_hol_militaryaccess:0 "네덜란드에게 군사통행권 요청"
GER_ww1_hol_militaryaccess_desc:0 "Obviously, a war in Belgium will be more favorable for us if we can pass through the Netherlands, which would also give us an easy place to retreat to in case a battle went bad. Negotiations should prove successful, so long as we don't accidentally refer to their country as just ''Holland''. They hate that." #KAISER_ANONY

GER_ww1_friend_sweden:0 "스웨덴을 동맹국에 초대하다"
GER_ww1_friend_sweden_desc:0 "While it's a long shot, Sweden may be persuaded to join with the Central Powers if we promise to restore their hold on Finland. Though it's not terribly likely for them to accept such a proposition, we need all the friends we can get, and we lose nothing by at the very least asking, right?"
