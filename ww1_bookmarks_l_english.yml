 # 1910

 POWDERKEG_NAME:0 "유럽의 화약고"
 POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "1910년은 유럽의 평화를 저해하는 시대입니다. 이탈리아는 오스만 제국과의 전쟁을 준비하고 있고, 이는 발칸반도에 큰 위협을 가져다 줄 것입니다. 모로코에서의 반란은 뜻밖의 결과를 가져오게 됩니다, 프랑스에게는 큰 고통을, 독일 제국에게는 큰 기쁨을 주게 됩니다. 무엇보다도, 전쟁을 이기기 위해서는 평화를 유지하거나 강심장이 되야할 것입니다."

 FRA_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "1870년, 프랑스는 독일제국이 성립되는 과정에서 알자스-로렌 지방을 전쟁에서 잃은 것에 큰 타격을 받았다.  그 이후로 독일 프랑스의 상처를 건들여와서 독일은 프랑스의 불구대천지원수가 되었다. \n\n다행히도, 프랑스는 외교를 통해 영국과 러시아와 삼국동맹을 맺었다. 전쟁이 발발한다면 독일은 처참히 짓 밟힐 것이다. 문제는 "언제" 전쟁이 발발할 것이냐."

 USA_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "유럽이 다가오는 전쟁의 위기에 비참해지고 있는 반면, 1910년, 미국은 평화와 번영만이 가득하다. 달러 외교의 성공과 루즈벨트의 성공적인 결과는 마침내 유럽열강들로 부터 라틴 아메리카를 수호하기에 이른다. 필리핀은 유럽열강들을 평정하기에 적합했다. \n\n물론 이러한 행위는 어리석은 짓이지만, 지금 당장은 미국이 유럽열강들을 상대할 준비를 하기에는 안전하다."

 ENG_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "대영제국은 아직도 친정에 관심이 많다. 방대한 아프리카, 아시아, 그리고 아메리카지역을 자치령으로 직접통치하고 있다, 하지만 대영제국이 아직 정복하지 못 한 곳이 있다 바로 유럽이다. 영국은 유럽본토에 동맹국들이 있지만, 그들을 탐탁히 여기지 않는다. \n\n물론, 좋은 왕이었던 에드워드는 이 세계에 그리 오래있지 못 했다, 그리고 조지 왕세자는 이제 이 문제를 뒤흔들 시간이다. 다음 왕은 유럽내 영국 영토를 확보하기 위해 무슨 짓을 벌일까?"

 GER_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "이제 35개의 국가들이 독일 제국으로 하나가 됬다, 많은 이들이 세계 최고의 권력을 가진 국가로 보고 있습니다. 반면에, 독일을 깔보는 국가들도 있었습니다. 독일의 주적인 프랑스는 영국, 러시아와 함께 삼국협상을 결성했으며, 이들은 모두 독일의 하찮은 동맹들보다도 강했습니다. \n\n낡은 오스트리아와 불충실한 이탈리아, 독일은 다가오는 시대에서 살아남기 위해 더 많은 동맹국이나 힘이 필요 합니다."

 ITA_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "이탈리아는 삼국동맹에서 가장 작습니다. 또한 동맹에서 소극적입니다. 이탈리아의 숙적이였던 오스트리아-헝가리는 조약을 통해 아군이 되었습니다. 하지만 실질적으론 아직 적대관계입니다. 어찌됬건 이탈리아는 오스트리아가 소유하고 있는 달마티아에 영유권을 주장하고 있습니다. 지금현재 다른 한편으론 압박 중인 여러 문제가 있습니다.\n\n오스만과의 전쟁계획을 수립한 상태입니다. 정부가 앞으로 할 일은 단 한가지, 전쟁입니다. 이탈리아의 힘을 보여줄 때입니다."

 AUH_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "The last century was a curse to the Austrian throne. Humiliation after humiliation was thrust upon her, from the rampage of Napoleon to the unification of Germany by the Prussians. Venerable old Kaiser Franz Josef now stands as the weakest member of the Triple Alliance, with two of her old enemies. But surprisingly, this has gone well for Austria so far. \n\nThe Hapsburgs have inherited Bosnia, and the people of Hungary finally seem placated. Perhaps more good shall come."

 RUS_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Recent years have not been kind to the Russian Empire. With a major military defeat at the hands of Japan, followed by a revolution that forced the once-invincible Tsar into a constitution, the Russian government must get back on its feet and prove its strength again, or risk revolution. \n\nLuckily, the Balkans are turbulent again. The crumbling Ottoman Empire is Russia's opportunity to expand, create new puppet states, and more importantly, prove it is still a world power."

 TUR_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Storm clouds are gathering over Kostantiniyye. Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria have been scheming together again- likely a war to try and claim the territory they unrightfully claim is theirs. The Albanians are close to revolt. The Italian government is also very publicly contemplating a conquest of the Tripoli Vilayet. \n\nLoss of territory is nearly inevitable. Ottoman Diplomacy, therefore, should center around ensuring we keep the capital, if nothing else."

 SER_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Serbia is seen by outsiders as a backwater, minor nation. Nothing more than a pawn in a great game that the world's empires are playing as each other. Of course, the empires of the world may learn sooner than they think that the Serbs are destined for greater things. \n\nCurrently, most Serbs live outside our borders, in Turkish or Austrian territory. If we are to make a deal with the devil- the Bulgarians- the Serbs may begin their road for glory by way of full Serbian unification."

 BUL_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Bulgaria has already made a name for itself through successful conflicts against the Serbs and outmaneuvering the Ottoman Empire to unify with Eastern Rumelia. Of course, now the state stands at a more uncomfortable position. The Turks seem unwilling to put up any more Bulgarian territory for grabs, and the Russians are slowly withdrawing their support. \n\nPerhaps it is not too late to mend fences with Serbia? After all, a Bulgaria with strong friends could be a surprising menace."

 MEX_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "The Mexico of 1910 is a strange case indeed. The Porfiriato has been a great boon to Mexico since 1876, but now that the heat has been turned up, it seems President Diaz's time may be limited. Of course, the Government sees this as biting the hand. \n\nFrancisco Madero is actively and obviously plotting against the Diaz government. If he finds himself ambitious enough, he may see Mexico in his own back pocket yet."

 JAP_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "In just under 50 years, Japan has turned from a backwards despotate ruled by a Shogun to a proper modern Empire, just as powerful as any country Europe has to offer. Emperor Meiji is to thank for it, but sadly he is both old and diseased- and can't possibly live much longer. \n\nBefore Crown Prince Yoshihito takes the crown, there are a few more matters to settle, however. The elderly emperor must decide where Japan stands with Russia, and what to do with the Korean vassal."

 # 1914

 SCHLIEFFEN_NAME:0 "세계대전"
 SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "전쟁의 북은 격렬히 요동 치고 있습니다. 내년에는, 최소한 프랑스와 러시아vs독일과 오스트리아-헝가리 구도로 전쟁이 일어날 것입니다. 더 많은 세력들이 개입한다면, 지금까지보지 못 했던 어마어마한 전쟁이 될 것입니다. 한 가지는 분명합니다, 많은 국가들이 전쟁에 출현하게 될겁니다."

 FRA_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "France's revanche is soon at hand. The return of the Tricolor to Alsace-Lorraine and the rightful French territory owned by the Germans in Africa, seems nearer than ever. Of course, the Germans are just as ready to strike, but France's time to prove a lesson learned is now. \n\nAfter all, surely all that will be needed is the French Élan that was missing from the last war, and the Germans will be sent packing. Of course, there's rumors a long war could be to our disadvantage, but rumors aren't always true, are they?"

 USA_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The United States is an isolated, pacifist country, as it has been since Theodore Roosevelt's administration. However, the climate of the world today leaves little room for a nation with America's power to stay out of these affairs. Though Wilson has ran a campaign on isolationism, and seems to have little incentive to change course, the spirit of the Great War could easily force the U.S.A.'s hand. \n\n With Mexico unstable and Europe at each others' throats, how long can the U.S. rise above the fight?"

 ENG_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The situation in Europe has become too much to bear. Germany and France are both far too close to Britain's position for the comfort of the British public. The Kaiser even has the gall to challenge the Royal Navy's dominance. When the war all fear is to come, something simply must be done. Or must it? \n\nThere is the option to let France and Germany grind each other down and build ourselves up. Of course, British troops MUST get involved if Germany- or France, perhaps- end up attacking any British allies..."

 GER_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Herr von Bismarck's prediction that the next war will start with a spark from the powder keg of the Balkans seems to be furbther and further approaching reality. With all of the tension stemming from the region, there's no doubt a war between German and French alliances will break out soon. Germany, therefore, must be prepared. \n\nThe time for diplomacy is over. The German Army must be readied for what could be a long, gruesome, and, worst of all, two-front war."

 ITA_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "22 years ago, Italy halfheartedly joined the Triple Alliance with Germany and the hated Austrians to spite France's gains in Tunisia. Today, the alliance is the most shaky in Europe. With her old alliance, Italy has the chance to get Savoy, Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia for herself. However, the Entente would provide the Dalmatian coast- and seems much more able to do so. \n\nItaly still has time before the war to make a decision. But on which side does her fate lay?"

 AUH_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Austria-Hungary is a resilient state, and has survived much hardship where other states would be destroyed. Yet, the increasing support for Panslavism in Russia combined with the fervor for war in the Balkans poses a threat that may very well spell the end of the Hapsburg rule. Worse yet, the rivalry with the Italians has started again in earnest. \n\nAustria must quell the fury of the Balkan states and stand with Germany against her enemies, or the Empire may become just a cherished memory."

 RUS_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The Balkan Wars did little to calm the people of the Russian Empire. Though Russia had thrown their support behind the South Slavic powers, only Serbia and Montenegro are loyal to the empire of the east, and crisis is on the horizon if things don't change- and now. Serbian extremists have proposed trying to break a war out with Austria-Hungary, and this is exactly what Russia needs. \n\nThe clear goals of German Poland and the Slavic lands in Austria are in Russia's sights."

 TUR_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "What was once the world's greatest empire has now fallen to near ruin. The Sultanate is no longer considered a major power in Europe, and the carving of Turkey between all of the European powers is a constant threat that crawls closer and closer to reality. To make matters worse, the incompetent Enver Pasha has seized effective control of the government. \n\nThe best course of action, according to the Porte, is to draw close to Germany, and hope their mighty army can protect us in our time of need."

 SER_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The Balkan Wars saw a massive success for Serbia, as well as their most important ally in Greece. The hard part, however has just begun: The Habsburgs still hold the region of Bosnia, as well as other South Slavic territories. Worse yet, they see Serbia as a troublemaker, and would be more than happy to rid the world of the state at a moment's notice. \n\nFortunately, Russia seems to have taken a liking to Serbia, though perhaps for malicious reasons. If Tsar Peter utilizes this, the world may change forever..."

 BUL_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Bulgaria was wrong to trust the Greeks and the Romanians to stay out of the inevitable conflict between themselves and Serbia, and are down to the lowest territorial extent since independence from the Ottoman Empire. It is unlikely they will be fooled twice. Russia seems next in the line of false friends, seeking only to profit from the state. \n\nThe only countries that seem to genuinely have Bulgaria's best interests at heart are Germany and Austria. Perhaps it's time for a new alliance?"

 MEX_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "While initially it seemed Madero's victory in the first phase of the Mexican Civil War was the end of it, in 1913 he was deposed, killed, and replaced by one of his former generals, Victoriano Huerta. Huerta is not popular or terribly competent, and few see him lasting long in command of the nation. \n\nStill, there is no agreement among the Mexican populace as to who is to be the next leader. Some rally behind causes as extreme as Communism or Military Dictatorship. Will Civil War rear its ugly head again?"

 JAP_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Unfortunately, it turns out Emperor Taisho is cursed with mental afflictions which have severely impacted his ability to rule. Fortunately for Japan, his ministers and other members of the Imperial court have begun to administrate Japan, whose public is getting its first taste of liberty. \n\nBut still, what of the war in Europe? Would it be to Japan's benefit to throw in? After all, the British-Japanese alliance is tenuous at best, and Japan may be better off simply waiting to choose which side will serve its interests."
